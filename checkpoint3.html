            <h3>1. App Motor Control & Bluetooth Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                For Checkpoint 3, the team’s primary focus was getting reliable motor control from the
                mobile app through Bluetooth. Initially, all Bluetooth work was done in C, and the team
                successfully connected to the Raspberry Pi. However, none of the motor control commands
                could be transmitted reliably from the phone to the Pi within the C-only solution.
            </p>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                After running into repeated issues, the team asked Dr. Herring on November 4, 2025,
                whether Python could be used for the Bluetooth connection while keeping the rest of the
                project in C. The initial email response allowed the use of Python on the Raspberry Pi for
                Bluetooth, with the constraint that the phone and RP4 must be able to reconnect after
                forgetting the device. A later follow-up email on November 6, 2025, clarified that if
                Bluetooth remained in Python and the rest of the embedded code stayed in C, the project
                would not receive full credit; the professor emphasized that other groups had achieved a
                C-based setup. 
            </p>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                This put the team at a disadvantage because those groups used Android/Windows, while this
                team used an iPhone/Mac stack. By talking with another iOS/Mac group (Gaelan &amp; Blake),
                they confirmed that the C-based approach was also failing there. The key technical
                difference turned out to be the underlying Bluetooth profiles: other teams relied on
                RFCOMM/Serial Port Profile, which is not supported for third-party iOS apps. 
            </p>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <h4>RFCOMM vs BLE GATT</h4>
            <p>
                Through extensive AI-assisted research and experimentation, the team verified that
                RFCOMM is simple to implement but incompatible with standard iOS apps, while BLE
                GATT is more complex but fully supported and is the industry standard for BLE. In the
                CP3 report:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Figure 1</strong> highlights the conceptual differences between BLE GATT and RFCOMM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Figure 2</strong> compares how an Android phone can easily use RFCOMM, while iOS
                    requires GATT for third-party apps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Figure 3</strong> contrasts the code complexity: a short RFCOMM socket sequence versus
                    a multi-step BLE GATT flow involving services, characteristics, BlueZ daemons, and
                    D-Bus messaging.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                Confirming that RFCOMM was not viable on iOS was a key milestone. It validated the
                team’s concerns that they were being asked to solve a significantly harder problem than
                groups using Android/Windows, and it explained why a naive C+RFCOMM port would
                never work on their platform. 
            </p>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                Despite these constraints, the team persisted—iterating with multiple AIs, testing
                alternative code paths, and documenting the incompatibilities. This checkpoint represents
                the turning point where the team began narrowing the solution toward a BLE-centric
                design while still honoring the project’s C-based requirements as much as possible.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Website Development</h3>
            <p>
                In parallel with the Bluetooth work, the team continued improving the project website that
                showcases the PARMCO system. The initial HTML structure was generated with
                <strong>Google Gemini</strong> after feeding it the Final Project directions plus the Checkpoint 1 and
                Checkpoint 2 documentation. From there, <strong>Claude</strong> was used to refine styling, layout,
                and overall aesthetics, giving the site a more polished, professional appearance. 
            </p>

            <img src="website_images\initial_website.png" 
                alt="Initial Website" 
                class="expandable-image"
                onclick="openImageModal(this)">

            <p class="center-caption">

            </p>


            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                The CP3 report’s <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows the main homepage view, including the hero section,
                navigation bar, and the early version of the project overview content embedded on the page.
            </p>

            <h3>3. AI Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                By Checkpoint 3, the team’s multi-AI workflow had shifted strongly toward using
                <strong>Claude</strong> as the primary assistant. Early in the semester, the plan was to balance
                Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. However, as the work became more complex,
                Claude consistently produced the most accurate and debuggable code for:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Bluetooth experiments and code snippets for BLE GATT</li>
                <li>Motor-drive logic and C-based control structures</li>
                <li>Refinements to the iOS app UI and behavior</li>
                <li>Styling improvements and structural changes for the project website</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                Gemini remained most useful for the initial HTML skeleton of the website, while Claude
                handled the majority of subsequent code refinement. The team notes that one recurring
                challenge was that AIs would confidently propose solutions that were incompatible with the
                specific iOS/Mac + Raspberry Pi hardware configuration; this forced the team to
                cross-check answers, test prototypes, and reason beyond the AI output rather than blindly
                trusting it. 
            </p>

            <span class="small-break"></span>

            <p>
                Overall, Checkpoint 3 documents a phase where technical difficulty, platform limitations,
                and grading constraints collided—but also where the team’s persistence, documentation
                quality, and website progress positioned them for the final integration in later checkpoints.
